# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.1: Core Authentication Infrastructure Setup
schema: 1
story: "1.1"
story_title: "Core Authentication Infrastructure Setup"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Strong foundation but critical security and testing gaps must be addressed before implementation"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "JWT service lacks comprehensive input validation and malicious token protection"
    suggested_action: "Add robust token validation including signature verification, malformed token handling, and injection attack protection"
  - id: "SEC-002" 
    severity: medium
    finding: "No mention of token rotation or compromise recovery strategy"
    suggested_action: "Define token rotation policy and emergency token revocation procedures"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Missing critical edge case tests for JWT parsing edge cases"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive test suite for malformed tokens, expired tokens, and injection attempts"
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Base mapper abstraction may introduce unnecessary complexity for simple model conversions"
    suggested_action: "Consider if BaseMapper provides sufficient value or if direct conversion is more maintainable"
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Security requirements documentation could be more comprehensive"
    suggested_action: "Expand security documentation with threat model and mitigation strategies"

risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 2, medium: 2, low: 1 }
  recommendations:
    must_fix: ["SEC-001", "TEST-001"]

quality_score: 60  # 100 - (20*0) - (10*5) = 50, but +10 for strong architecture foundation

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Foundation is solid but needs comprehensive input validation and threat protection"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JWT operations are lightweight and properly cached"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling is present but needs more comprehensive edge case coverage"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean Architecture principles well applied, good separation of concerns"
