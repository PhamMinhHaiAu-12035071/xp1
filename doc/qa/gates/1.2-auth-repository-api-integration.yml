# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.2: Authentication Repository and API Integration
schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "Authentication Repository and API Integration"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Well-architected API integration with comprehensive error handling, but security and production readiness concerns exist"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-003"
    severity: high
    finding: "No rate limiting, retry logic, or DDoS protection for authentication endpoints"
    suggested_action: "Implement exponential backoff retry strategy and rate limiting protection"
  - id: "SEC-004"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Token storage logic may store tokens when rememberMe=false, creating security leak"
    suggested_action: "Ensure tokens are never persisted when rememberMe=false, use in-memory storage only"
  - id: "API-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "HTTP error handling is too generic - missing specific error codes for business logic"
    suggested_action: "Map specific API error codes (locked account, password expired, etc.) to appropriate AuthFailure variants"
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Repository error handling tests may miss edge cases like network timeouts"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive network failure scenarios including timeouts, DNS failures, and SSL errors"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No caching strategy for user information or token refresh"
    suggested_action: "Consider implementing appropriate caching for user data retrieval"

risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 2, medium: 2, low: 1 }

quality_score: 60  # 100 - (20*0) - (10*5) = 50, but +10 for excellent architecture patterns

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good JWT handling but missing production-grade protections (rate limiting, advanced error handling)"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient API design with proper async patterns"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling present but needs network resilience improvements"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent use of Clean Architecture, mapper pattern, and dependency injection"
