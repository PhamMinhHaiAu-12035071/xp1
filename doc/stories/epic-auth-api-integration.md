# Authentication API Integration - Brownfield Enhancement Epic

## Epic Goal

Replace the existing fake authentication system with real JWT-based API integration while preserving all existing UI components and user experience, enabling secure user authentication with token management and automatic refresh capabilities.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Login UI with form validation, fake 2-second delay authentication, proper error handling UI
- **Technology stack:** Flutter, BLoC, Clean Architecture, GetIt/Injectable DI, environment configuration system
- **Integration points:** Login form widgets, environment configuration, navigation routing, state management

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** 
  - Remove `Future.delayed(2 seconds)` fake authentication
  - Add Chopper HTTP client with JWT token management
  - Implement secure storage for JWT tokens with FlutterSecureStorage
  - Create Clean Architecture layers for authentication (Domain/Infrastructure)
  - Add proper error handling for network failures and token expiry

- **How it integrates:** 
  - Leverages existing environment configuration for API URLs
  - Maintains existing login form UI components
  - Integrates with current BLoC state management
  - Uses existing dependency injection container

- **Success criteria:** 
  - Users can authenticate with real credentials
  - JWT tokens stored securely and refreshed automatically
  - Existing UI behavior preserved
  - Network failures handled gracefully with user feedback

## Stories

### 1. Story 1: Core Authentication Infrastructure Setup
   - Create domain entities (UserEntity, TokenEntity, AuthFailure)
   - Implement JWT service and secure storage service
   - Set up Chopper HTTP client with environment integration
   - Add required dependencies and code generation setup

### 2. Story 2: Authentication Repository and API Integration
   - Create authentication API service with Chopper
   - Implement AuthRepository with real login/logout/refresh functionality  
   - Add mappers for API models to domain entities
   - Integrate with secure token storage

### 3. Story 3: Login Form Integration and State Management
   - Remove fake authentication delay from login form
   - Connect AuthBloc to real authentication repository
   - Add proper loading states and error handling
   - Implement automatic token refresh and logout functionality

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ **Existing APIs remain unchanged:** Login form interface preserved
- ✅ **Database schema changes are backward compatible:** No database changes
- ✅ **UI changes follow existing patterns:** No UI component changes
- ✅ **Performance impact is minimal:** JWT operations are lightweight

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing login flow during integration
- **Mitigation:** Preserve all existing UI components and interfaces, implement behind feature flag if needed
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to fake authentication by restoring `Future.delayed(2 seconds)` logic

## Definition of Done

- ✅ **All stories completed with acceptance criteria met**
- ✅ **Existing functionality verified through testing:** Login UI behavior unchanged
- ✅ **Integration points working correctly:** Environment config, navigation, state management
- ✅ **Documentation updated appropriately:** API integration patterns documented
- ✅ **No regression in existing features:** All existing login UI flows preserved

## Technical Context

- ✅ No architectural documentation is required
- ✅ Enhancement follows existing patterns
- ✅ Integration complexity is manageable

### Risk Assessment
- ✅ Risk to existing system is low
- ✅ Rollback plan is feasible
- ✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality
- ✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points

### Completeness Check
- ✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
- ✅ Stories are properly scoped
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Dependencies are identified

## Story Manager Handoff

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running **Flutter with Clean Architecture, BLoC state management, GetIt/Injectable DI**
- Integration points: **Environment configuration system, existing login form widgets, navigation routing, BLoC state management**
- Existing patterns to follow: **Repository pattern, Domain/Infrastructure layers, dependency injection with @injectable, environment-based configuration**
- Critical compatibility requirements: **Preserve all existing login UI components, maintain current user experience, no breaking changes to navigation flow**
- Each story must include verification that existing login form behavior and user experience remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering **real JWT-based authentication with secure token storage and automatic refresh**.

## Epic Summary

This brownfield epic transforms the authentication system from "UI theater" to real functionality while preserving the excellent existing user interface. The 3-story approach ensures minimal risk with maximum value delivery:

1. **Foundation** (Infrastructure setup)
2. **Integration** (API and repository implementation)  
3. **Connection** (Login form integration)

The epic respects the existing architecture while adding the critical missing piece - real authentication infrastructure.
