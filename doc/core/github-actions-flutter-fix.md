# 🔧 GitHub Actions Flutter PATH Fix

## 📋 Problem Summary

The project was experiencing "Flutter not found in PATH after setup" errors in GitHub Actions despite FVM successfully installing Flutter. This was caused by PATH persistence issues between workflow steps and incomplete environment variable setup.

## 🎯 Root Causes Identified

1. **PATH Export Timing**: FVM binaries were not being properly added to PATH for subsequent workflow steps
2. **Environment Variable Persistence**: Flutter and Dart paths were not persisting across GitHub Actions steps
3. **Verification Gaps**: Insufficient debugging and verification steps made it hard to diagnose issues
4. **Fallback Strategy Missing**: No alternative setup method in case FVM encountered issues

## ✅ Applied Fixes

### 1. Enhanced FVM Installation (`flutter-setup/action.yml`)

**Before**: Basic FVM installation with minimal PATH handling
**After**: Robust installation with:

- Multiple verification checks
- Proper shell sourcing for FVM
- Environment variable persistence (`GITHUB_ENV`)
- Detailed debugging output

```yaml
# Key improvements:
- Enhanced PATH exports to GITHUB_PATH
- Added FLUTTER_HOME, DART_HOME environment variables
- Multiple fallback strategies for different FVM configurations
- Comprehensive verification steps with detailed error messages
```

### 2. Improved Flutter Setup Process

**Before**: Single-path assumption for Flutter location
**After**: Multiple fallback strategies:

- Primary: `$HOME/.fvm/versions/{version}/bin`
- Fallback: `$HOME/.fvm/default/bin`
- Verification of binary existence before PATH addition

### 3. Enhanced Debug and Verification

**Added comprehensive debugging**:

- PATH information logging
- Binary existence verification
- Version information display
- Detailed error messages with actionable information

### 4. Workflow-Level PATH Reinforcement

**Updated main workflow** to ensure PATH availability:

- Added PATH exports in critical steps
- Flutter accessibility verification before RPS commands
- Consistent `flutter` usage instead of `fvm flutter` where appropriate

### 5. Backup Workflow Creation

**Created `flutter-stable.yaml`**:

- Uses reliable `subosito/flutter-action`
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch) by default
- Can be activated if FVM issues persist
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with build and test steps

## 🔍 How the Fix Works

### Path Persistence Strategy

```bash
# 1. Install FVM and add to PATH
echo "$HOME/.fvm/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

# 2. Set up Flutter/Dart paths with fallbacks
FLUTTER_BIN_PATH="$HOME/.fvm/versions/{version}/bin"
echo "$FLUTTER_BIN_PATH" >> $GITHUB_PATH

# 3. Export environment variables for persistence
echo "FLUTTER_ROOT=$FLUTTER_VERSION_PATH" >> $GITHUB_ENV
echo "FLUTTER_HOME=$FLUTTER_VERSION_PATH" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### Verification Strategy

```bash
# 1. Verify FVM accessibility
if ! command -v fvm &> /dev/null; then
  # Error with debugging info
fi

# 2. Verify Flutter accessibility
if ! command -v flutter &> /dev/null; then
  # Error with path information
fi

# 3. Display version information
flutter --version --suppress-analytics
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Primary Setup (FVM-based)

The enhanced setup in `.github/actions/flutter-setup/action.yml` should now work reliably:

```yaml
- name: 🔧 Setup Flutter
  uses: ./.github/actions/flutter-setup
  with:
    flutter-version: ${{ env.FLUTTER_VERSION }}
```

### Backup Setup (if needed)

If FVM issues persist, enable the backup workflow:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/flutter-stable.yaml`
2. Change `workflow_dispatch` to `push` and `pull_request`
3. The workflow will use `subosito/flutter-action` instead of FVM

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you still encounter PATH issues:

1. **Check the workflow logs** for the new debugging output
2. **Verify FVM installation** - look for "FVM is accessible at:" messages
3. **Check PATH exports** - verify the path additions are happening
4. **Use backup workflow** - enable `flutter-stable.yaml` for comparison

### Common Error Patterns:

| Error                                   | Likely Cause                            | Solution                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "FVM not found in PATH"                 | FVM installation failed                 | Check FVM installation step logs |
| "Flutter not found in PATH after setup" | PATH not persisting                     | Check GITHUB_PATH additions      |
| "Build runner command failed"           | Flutter not accessible in workflow step | Verify PATH exports in that step |
