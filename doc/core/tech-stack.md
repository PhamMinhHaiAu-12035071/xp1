## Architecture Patterns

### BLoC Pattern Implementation
```
lib/
├── counter/
│   ├── cubit/
│   │   └── counter_cubit.dart    # Business logic
│   ├── view/
│   │   └── counter_page.dart     # UI components
│   └── counter.dart              # Barrel export
```

### App Structure
```
lib/
├── app/
│   ├── view/
│   │   └── app.dart              # Main app widget
│   └── app.dart                  # Barrel export
├── l10n/                         # Internationalization
├── bootstrap.dart                # App initialization
└── main_*.dart                   # Environment entry points
```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
# Development
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
very_good test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random

# Generate coverage report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/
open coverage/index.html
```

### Code Generation
```bash
# Generate localizations
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

## Dependencies Management

### Production Dependencies
- `bloc`: State management core
- `flutter_bloc`: Flutter BLoC integration
- `flutter_localizations`: Localization support
- `intl`: Internationalization utilities

### Development Dependencies
- `bloc_test`: BLoC testing utilities
- `flutter_test`: Flutter testing framework
- `mocktail`: Mocking framework
- `very_good_analysis`: Code analysis

## Configuration Files

### Analysis Options
- `analysis_options.yaml`: Dart analysis configuration
- `very_good_analysis`: Very Good Ventures coding standards

### Localization
- `l10n.yaml`: Localization configuration
- `lib/l10n/arb/`: ARB files for translations

### Build Configuration
- `pubspec.yaml`: Project dependencies and configuration
- `pubspec.lock`: Locked dependency versions

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Separation of business logic (cubit) and UI (view)
- Barrel exports for clean imports

### State Management
- Use BLoC pattern for complex state
- Keep cubits focused and single-purpose
- Proper error handling in state management

### Testing
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- BLoC tests for state management
- Coverage reporting enabled

### Internationalization
- All user-facing strings in ARB files
- Proper locale support configuration
- Generated localization classes

## Performance Considerations

### Build Optimization
- Multi-environment builds for different deployment targets
- Proper asset management
- Code splitting where applicable

### Runtime Performance
- Efficient BLoC state management
- Proper widget rebuild optimization
- Memory management best practices

## Security Considerations

### Code Analysis
- Very Good Ventures analysis rules
- Static analysis for security issues
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Platform Security
- Platform-specific security configurations
- Proper permission handling
- Secure storage practices

## Deployment

### Build Flavors
- Development: Debug builds with development configuration
- Staging: Release builds with staging configuration
- Production: Release builds with production configuration

### Platform Deployment
