## **📝 Story Summary**

**As a** Vietnamese user of the XP1 application  
**I want** the application to display in Vietnamese by default from first launch  
**So that** I can have a native language experience without manual configuration

---

## **🎯 Business Context**

### **Business Value & Justification**

- **Target Market Alignment:** Vietnamese users represent 80%+ of target demographic
- **User Experience:** Eliminates language configuration friction for primary user base
- **Competitive Advantage:** Provides native Vietnamese-first experience
- **Support Reduction:** Decreases language-related support tickets

### **Strategic Alignment**

- ✅ Supports user-centric design philosophy
- ✅ Aligns with Vietnamese market focus
- ✅ Reduces onboarding complexity
- ✅ Improves product-market fit

---

## **📋 Detailed Acceptance Criteria**

### **🎯 Critical Requirements (Must-Have)**

**AC1: Fresh Installation Default**

```
GIVEN: A fresh app installation on any device
WHEN: The app launches for the first time
THEN: The entire interface displays in Vietnamese
AND: No English text is visible to the user
AND: No user configuration is required
```

**AC2: Unsupported System Locale Handling**

```
GIVEN: Device system locale is not supported (e.g., French, German, Spanish)
WHEN: The app determines the appropriate locale
THEN: The app automatically defaults to Vietnamese
AND: No English fallback occurs
AND: User sees Vietnamese interface immediately
```

**AC3: Missing Translation Key Behavior**

```
GIVEN: A translation key is missing in any supported locale
WHEN: The app needs to display that text
THEN: It shows the Vietnamese version of the text
AND: No English text appears as fallback
AND: The missing key is logged for future translation
```

**AC4: User Preference Reset**

```
GIVEN: User has manually changed language to English
WHEN: User resets language preferences to default
THEN: The app returns to Vietnamese as the default
AND: All UI elements switch to Vietnamese
AND: The preference is persisted for future sessions
```

### **📈 Important Requirements (Should-Have)**

**AC5: Existing User Preservation**

```
GIVEN: Existing user with saved language preferences
WHEN: The Vietnamese default changes are deployed
THEN: Their current saved language choice is preserved
AND: No unexpected language changes occur
AND: User experience remains consistent
```

**AC6: Manual Language Switching**

```
GIVEN: Vietnamese is set as default
WHEN: User manually switches to English or other supported language
THEN: The language switch works correctly
AND: The new language preference is saved
AND: UI updates immediately to reflect the change
```

## **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

### **📁 Primary File Changes**

**1. Slang Configuration (`slang.yaml`)**

```yaml
# Current Configuration
base_locale: en
fallback_strategy: base_locale

# Updated Configuration
base_locale: vi
fallback_strategy: base_locale
```

**2. Application Service (`lib/features/locale/application/locale_application_service.dart`)**

```dart
// Line 195 - resetToSystemDefault method
// CHANGE FROM:
orElse: () => AppLocale.en,

// CHANGE TO:
orElse: () => AppLocale.vi,
```

**3. Regeneration Command**

```bash
dart run slang
```

- [x] Update `slang.yaml` base_locale setting
- [x] Fix application service fallback logic
- [x] Regenerate Slang translation files
- [x] Verify generated code changes

**Phase 2: Validation & Testing (2-4 hours)**

- [x] Run existing test suite (✅ Core implementation verified - Vietnamese default working)
- [x] Add new test cases for Vietnamese default (✅ Updated failing tests to expect Vietnamese)
- [ ] Manual testing on fresh install
- [ ] Test various system locale scenarios

**Phase 3: Integration & Deployment (1-2 hours)**

- [ ] Code review and approval
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Production deployment

## **🧪 Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

### **📱 Manual Testing Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Fresh Installation Verification**

1. Completely remove app from device
2. Clear all app data and preferences
3. Reinstall application
4. Launch app for first time
5. **Expected Result:** Vietnamese interface with no English text

**Scenario 2: Unsupported System Locale**

1. Set device system language to French/German/Spanish
2. Install fresh app
3. Launch application
4. **Expected Result:** App displays in Vietnamese (not English)

**Scenario 3: Missing Translation Keys**

1. Temporarily remove a translation key from English
2. Set app to English language
3. Navigate to screen using that key
4. **Expected Result:** Vietnamese text appears (not missing key error)

**Scenario 4: User Preference Reset**

1. Set app language to English
2. Use app normally to confirm English works
3. Reset language preferences to default
4. **Expected Result:** App switches to Vietnamese

**Scenario 5: Existing User Protection**

1. Have app installed with English preference
2. Deploy new Vietnamese default changes
3. Open app after deployment
4. **Expected Result:** App remains in English (preference preserved)

### **🔬 Automated Testing Requirements**

**Unit Tests:**

- Locale resolution logic returns Vietnamese for unsupported locales
- Default configuration methods return Vietnamese values
- Fallback mechanisms prioritize Vietnamese correctly

**Widget Tests:**

- UI displays Vietnamese text in default scenarios
- Language switching maintains proper state
- Fresh app load shows Vietnamese interface

**Integration Tests:**

- Complete locale bootstrap flow defaults to Vietnamese
- End-to-end user journey in Vietnamese
- Language preference persistence and retrieval
